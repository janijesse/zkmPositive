## Secret Praise with zkMIPS: Verifiable Positivity

### The Challenge: Anonymous Recognition

Many people want to give compliments without revealing their identity, but they also want to ensure that these messages are genuine and meaningful.

### Solution: Zero-Knowledge Praise

- Anonymous submission of praise
- Verification of authenticity without disclosing the sender's identity
- An increase in the recipient's "positivity score"

### How It Works

1. Users generate a zkMIPS proof for their compliment.
2. This proof confirms the user's validity while keeping their identity private.
3. The praise is recorded, and the recipient's positivity score is updated.
4. Anyone can verify the process without accessing any personal details.

### The Result: Verifiable Positivity

This system creates a positive environment where compliments can be shared anonymously yet verified authentically, promoting mutual appreciation in a safe and reliable way.
